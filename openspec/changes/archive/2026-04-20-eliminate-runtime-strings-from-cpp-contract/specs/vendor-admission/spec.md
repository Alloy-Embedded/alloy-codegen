## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Vendor Admission SHALL Require Zero-String Runtime Reuse

A new family or vendor SHALL only be admitted when it reuses or extends the fully typed
zero-string runtime contract.

#### Scenario: New family reuses existing typed schemas
- **WHEN** a new family maps onto existing fully typed runtime schemas
- **THEN** vendor admission succeeds without requiring semantic string fields in runtime C++

#### Scenario: New family needs semantic labels in runtime C++
- **WHEN** a candidate family can only be represented by adding schema names, signal names,
  route kinds, or similar semantic strings to runtime-facing headers
- **THEN** vendor admission fails until those semantics are modeled as typed ids or refs
