# vendor-admission Specification

## Purpose

Define the policy that governs when a vendor or family is admitted into the supported
multi-vendor publication set.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Foundational vendor set is explicit

The admitted foundational vendor/family set MUST be explicitly documented.

#### Scenario: Foundational vendors are listed

- **WHEN** maintainers review current admission status
- **THEN** the admitted vendor/family set is explicit
- **AND** the source pattern used by each foundational family is documented

### Requirement: New vendor admission is gated

A new vendor beyond the admitted foundational set MUST NOT enter active implementation until
readiness gates are closed and an admission proposal exists.

#### Scenario: Admission checks bootstrap readiness

- **WHEN** a new vendor or family is considered publishable
- **THEN** Gates T7, T8, and T9 are closed
- **AND** no foundational family requires final-stage emitter or publish exceptions
- **AND** a completed vendor-admission proposal exists in `openspec/changes/`

### Requirement: CI enforces the admitted vendor set

The CI workflow MUST fail if unadmitted vendor directories appear in `patches/`.

#### Scenario: Unadmitted vendor directories are blocked

- **WHEN** the quality workflow scans `patches/`
- **THEN** any vendor directory outside the admitted set fails the build

### Requirement: Vendor admission proposals are complete

A proposal to admit a new vendor MUST answer the bootstrap and source questions needed to make
the vendor publishable and maintainable.

#### Scenario: Admission proposal covers the full checklist

- **WHEN** a new vendor-admission proposal is reviewed
- **THEN** it identifies vendor key, bootstrap family, source pattern, bootstrap devices,
  fixture plan, licensing notes, and gate plan

### Requirement: Additional families from admitted vendors are still gated

Admitted vendors MUST satisfy bootstrap stability and proposal requirements before adding new
families.

#### Scenario: Existing vendor expands to a new family

- **WHEN** an already admitted vendor adds another family
- **THEN** the bootstrap family has completed at least two stable publication cycles
- **AND** no outstanding CI exceptions exist for that vendor
- **AND** a proposal exists naming the new family, its devices, and its fixture plan

### Requirement: New vendor admission requires semantic and provenance readiness

Vendor/family admission MUST not be judged only by parser success or low-level artifact emission.

#### Scenario: Admission checks semantic readiness

- **WHEN** a new vendor or family is considered publishable
- **THEN** admission evaluates system-control coverage, capability coverage, and provenance quality
- **AND** the family is not considered foundational-ready if those remain heuristic or opaque
