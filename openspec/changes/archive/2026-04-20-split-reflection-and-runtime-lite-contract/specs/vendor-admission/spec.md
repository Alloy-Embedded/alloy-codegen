## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Vendor Admission SHALL Depend On Runtime-Lite Reuse

A new vendor or family SHALL NOT be considered admission-ready unless it reuses the runtime-lite
contract expected by foundational drivers, without requiring a new reflection-table hot path in
`alloy`.

#### Scenario: New family needs custom table-walk runtime glue

- **WHEN** a new family can only be consumed through handwritten reflection-table lookup in the
  runtime
- **THEN** vendor admission fails until codegen emits a compatible runtime-lite contract
